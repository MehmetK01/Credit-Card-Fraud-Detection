# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Machine Learning Analysis using the Credit Card Fraud Detection data set from Kaggle. I applied 3 different Models (Logistic Regression, GBM, Neural Networks). 

To address the imbalance existent in the data set, I apply the ROSE balancing. The first part of my analysis revolves around EDA and getting the data set better. I plot different graphs (incl. box-plots and density plots) to gather information as to the distribution of fraudulent transactions.

Afterwards, in my analysis I apply Logistic Regression, GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine), and Neural Networks. I print the results in a seperate txt file.
